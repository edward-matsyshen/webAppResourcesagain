<a href="https://web.dev/learn/design/">All About Responsive Design</a><br>
This 16 course site is a wonderful encyclopedia of tips and information related to responsive design and how to implement it with images, icons, layouts etc. The courses
also provide a video element as well, which is awesome! Showing end results and the step-by-steps of implemeting the "srcset" and "size" attribute. This is a great article 
(I don't know if I would classify this as an article, tutorial, or course) and I will efinanatly look back at this.

<a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-add-a-database-to-a-website-8d36d1e77316">Integrating Databases</a><br>
This site shows the "down and dirty" details of integrating your own database to your site. Fairly useful and a great refresher to me as I haven't really integrated databases to any 
website since PROG 110. I put this page here since out future project will have you design a website that implements API and databases. I will have to reference this and mutliple 
other sites to see how to properly implement pre-existing data to the project.

<a href="https://snipcart.com/blog/integrating-apis-introduction">Integrating APIs</a><br>
This one article is very specific to a project we will have in the future of this class. In the project, we will have to focus on integrating APIs and external/internal databases. 
Last night as I was typing out my Project Concept I remembered that I will need a constant refresher on integrating databases and API's. Integrating and correctly using 
a tilt/motion API was so difficult to do in my PROG 272 class. Reading this article made me remember more about where to find accessable API's, endpoints and using JSON to 
get API responses.

Goes in depth with dynamic layouts and image grids for your site. Personally, I believe that grids can make a huge difference in making your site look more polished and cleaner than your code appears.
Since one of my ideas for a website for this course is to make a <span class="redBold">Home-Depot</span></a>-like website, the use of grid for images is especially important to
learn how to properly implement.

Tania Rascia writes some great articles about everything related to Application Development and the basics and complexities of using certain programming. If it wasn't for 
the Responsive Web Discussion I would have probably never found this article. She talks about the step by step proccess of creating a site, choosing waht design to focus on,
and to manage trying to finish creating a site while tasking with structuring the site's layout, padding, hieght, colors, etc. She talks about writing your content first then 
worrying about design and not doing the opposite. She lists her guidelines/tips for the design she likes to use for her sites. I've actaully used a lot of her tips and
reccomendations for creating this very page.

I've decided to post a bonus site. This one is quite different from the rest.
A friend of mine I know, showed me his own resume site one day and I was very impressed. I love his stylization with CSS and how simple yet unique it is.
The green text behind a black screen is unique and just beautifully pops, and his use of a search bar looks so impressive.
For me, seeing a resume site or any site/game from someone I personally know is 10x more inspirational than most articles on software design.
Hit ctrl+u to see how neat his code is. :)
